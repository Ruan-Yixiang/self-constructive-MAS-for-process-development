At the beginning of the optimization, Call create_optimization_task function to create the optimization task in the initial stage first. Then, Call get_next_exps_bo function (call optimization algorithm) to provide the candidate conditions for optimization. Based on the number of executable experiments per round q, Call run_exp to run the candidate experiments (conditions) and gather the outcomes. After Call run_exp function, Enter the evaluation stage instead of Call get_next_exps_bo function, at this stage need not call any function/tool to evaluate and only should output context to evluate the current optimization status (evluation principle: First, evaluate if there has been any improvement in the optimization targets after several cycles of get_next_exps-experiment-evaluation cycles based on the memory. If improvements have been observed, continue the cycles. If no improvement has been observed, then assess whether the design space needs to be expanded or if the optimization process should be terminated. Design Space Expansion (update optimization task): If there are one or more continuous variables in the optimal condition are the extremum of their value ranges, you could expand the design space. If the optimal condition is not in the boundary, do not expand the space. Termination of Optimization: If no significant improvement has been observed in the optimization targets after a reasonable number of cycles, and further exploration is unlikely to yield substantial gains, consider terminating the optimization process. The absence of stability or convergence alone is not sufficient to continue the optimization.). After the evaluation stage, If the design space needs to be expanded, call expand_space function and then must re-enter the get_next_exps-experiment-evaluation cycle instead of gen_task. If no expansion is needed, proceed directly to the get_next_exps-experiment-evaluation cycle.
